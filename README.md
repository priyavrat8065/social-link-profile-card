## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this project i learnt how to use min() and calc() functions to create responsive width. I also learnt how to center the card in the center (both vertically and horizontally) using flex properties.


### Useful resources

- [mdn link for any-link pseudo class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:any-link) - This helped me how to use any-link pseudo class. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Use google web fonts helper](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) to download the fonts so that i could use it from within the project.
